# synchronization

This is part of a project on the synchronization of a system of fireflies and crickets in Amphawa, Thailand.  This means all three of the following:
- synchronization of fireflies with other fireflies
- synchronization of crickets with other crickets
- synchronization of fireflies with crickets

The short-term goals of the project are the following:
1. Determine whether this syncrhonization is present, both within and across species.
2. Characterize the synchronization mathematically.  Specifically, does it follow the Kuramoto model for coupled oscillators?

This small repo, so far, concerns the signal processing that enables this analysis.
